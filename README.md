# Big_Data_K_Means_Customer_Segmentation

## Dataset:

We have a csv which contains the salary and age of 300 customers.

## Requirement:

Solve the problem using map-reduce steps only.
Using KMeans library or APIs to solve the problem will not be accepted as a solution.
Databricks platform has to be used for this assignment.
Print the final results
a. First 10 customers for each segment
b. Centroid values of each segment
The notebook should contain two sections:
a. First section should demonstrate all the steps and their results
b. Last section should use "chaining map reduce" to create clusters from the initial data.
Use PEP8 standards for coding

## Aproach

We have used big data technique map reduce to perform K-Means algorithm for customer segmentation.

Method Used: Big Data - Map-Reduce
Platform: DataBricks
No of Clusters: 3
No of Iterations: 40
